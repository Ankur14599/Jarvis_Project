# Jarvis Project 

This project is inspired from Movie : Iron Man where the main character has his own personal virtual AI Assistant to do the task.<br/> This project takes the voice input from the user and performs various tasks like playing music ,<br/> sending message on WhatsApp,<br/> Telling the time , Opening google and Youtube and much more.

## Libraries Used 

Packages that I have majorly used for creating this project are.
1. Pyttsx3
2. SpeechRecognition
3. Webbrowser
4. os module
5. PyAudio



## Working of the code

Pyttsx3 Helps us to recognize whatever user is saying to us and using the SpeechRecognition we just convert the voice to text commands<br/>For each one a specific task is set to be performed.<br/>
To keep the code more readable , I have created a separate main.py from which our jarvis.py file fetches the basic functions.
